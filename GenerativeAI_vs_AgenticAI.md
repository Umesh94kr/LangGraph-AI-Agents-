# GENERATIVE AI 
- Models (transformers) that can generate new content like text, video and audio which resembles human data
- ChatGPT released GenAI starts (LLM based applications)
- (Image generation applications) (Code generation models) (TTS - Text to speech model)
- Video generation model (SoRA)
- GenAI model tries to understand distribution of data, so that it can generate a new data from it

#### Areas of GenAI use :
- Formatting/Drafting texts for mailing and making notes 
- Auto completion tools | Figuring errors (SDE Domain)
- Customer Support (AI agents or Chatbot)
- Education (Clearing Doubts | Learning a new topic)
- Designing | Advertisement | Generating new Clips

#### Lets solve a Problem with GenAI 
You are a HR, want to hire backend engineer 
Task1 : Create a JD
Task2 : Put on platform 
Task3 : Shortlisting 
Task4 : Interviewing 
Task5 : Offer Letter 
Task6 : Onboarding 

SOLUTION 
Step1 : Ask chatbot to generate a JD for backend engineer job
Step2 : Ask Chatbot where to put the JD
Step3 : Use to screen resume 
Step4 : Drafting email 
Step5 : Prepare questions to interview a candidate

Problems : 

Reactive - we put a prompt and chatbot answers 
Proactive - not able to understand what to do next 

Memory - No memory 

Actions - Our LLM can't take actions

Solutions :


# TRADITIONAL AI 
- Work in pre-generative AI era
- Data (Input -> Output) -> finding patterns
- Classification problems
- Regression Problem

# AGENTIC AI 
- Solving a Goal
- Is Proactive (can think of next step by itself)
- GenAI is building block of agentic AI

## What is Agentic AI 
Characteristic of Agentic AI :
- autonomous
- Memory
- Planning 
- Action 
- Goal oriented
- Context Aware 

#### Autonomy 
- ability of making decisions on own to achieve a specific goal 
- proactive
- Control autonomy 
    - Limit tools and actions it can use
    - Human in Loop 
    - Override controls 
    - Guradrails (Hrad rules and ethical boundries)

# LangChain vs LangGraph 



LangGraph is used to designed complex graphical iterative workflows using nodes and edges.
